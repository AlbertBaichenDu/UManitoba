## Description

To whom working on this:
This contains all scripts and protocols that follow-up works can recycle. Since no external access to recordings and annotations are available as of now, please let me know at baichen@connect.hku.hk or albertbaichendu@berkeley.edu in case any isses emerge. And I am happy to have a Zoom call if you have any questions about the annotation process.

The pipeline:

1. Annotate accroding to the instructions, as shown in the pdf file.
2. Measure F0 using the Praat script. 
3. Move all results into the results folder.
4. Move all meta data, including the adex and smartphone data into respective folders.
5. Initiate the R project and open the Rmd script.
6. Execute everything.
