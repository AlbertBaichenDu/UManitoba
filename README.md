## Description

To whom working on this:
This contains all scripts and protocols that follow-up works can recycle. Since no external access to recordings and annotations are available as of now, please let me know at baichen@connect.hku.hk or albertbaichendu@berkeley.edu in case any isses emerge. And I am happy to have a Zoom meeting if you have any questions about the annotation process.
